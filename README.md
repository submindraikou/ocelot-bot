# Ocelot Bot

GroupMe bot developed for use in my dorm GroupMe. This bot can be hosted on Heroku and with a KVStore.io key you can have a small amount of storage to keep track of things between saves.

This is the public version that I only update occasionally whenever a new feature is added and bug free. Feel free to use the issues tab to ask any questions you have and I'll try my best to explain!

Currently the main function of this bot is to coordinate people trying to sell things in a large chat. One of the issues with my dorm chat is that sometimes a textbook is being sold and another student would like to buy it, but those two people never meet due to the discussion that occurs inbetween. With this bot the seller can ~sell short item description, optional amount optional price to create a listing for their textbook and the student looking to buy a used textbook can see the listing with ~list and contact the original seller with ~buy item.

TODO: Add tutorial on how to add this bot to your own GroupMe chat...
