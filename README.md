# Ocelot Bot

GroupMe bot developed for use in my dorm GroupMe. This bot can be hosted on Heroku and with a KVStore.io key you can have a small amount of storage to keep track of things between saves.

This is the public version that I only update occasionally whenever a new feature is added and bug free. Feel free to use the issues tab to ask any questions you have and I'll try my best to explain!

TODO: Add tutorial on how to add this bot to your own GroupMe chat...

Based off of [Cool Guy Bot](https://github.com/groupme/bot-tutorial-nodejs).
